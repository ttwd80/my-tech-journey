# My Tech Journey

I am from Malaysia ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¾.
From 2008 - 2013, I have tried to get a tech job in
USA/Canada/UK/Ireland/Australia/New Zealand/Singapore multiple times and failed.
In 2014, I managed to get an offer from Amazon Web Service in Australia.
In 2015 I started working as a Cloud Support Engineer for AWS.
The purpose of this document is to serve as a guide so that
it won't take you 5 years to change your life (if that is what you want to do).
